# CLAUDE.md — working on Magnetball

Guidance for Claude Code (or any contributor) working in this repo.

## What this is
A **single-file** HTML5 canvas game. **Everything lives in `index.html`** — HTML, CSS, and all game
JS (wrapped in one `(function(){ "use strict"; … })()` IIFE). There is **no build step, no bundler,
no package manager, and no runtime dependencies**. `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, `icon.svg`,
`assets/` and `settings/index.html` are the only other runtime files.

**Hard rules**
- Keep it dependency-free and self-contained. No npm packages shipped to the page, no CDN scripts,
  no external fonts/images required to play (assets in `assets/` are optional enhancements with
  graceful fallback).
- Everything is served over relative paths (`./`, `sw.js`, `assets/…`) so it works at any root.
- Prefer editing `index.html` in place; match the surrounding terse, comment-light-but-present style.

## Architecture (all in `index.html`)
- **Loop:** `loop(t)` → fixed-timestep accumulator calling `step(w)` at `STEP = 1/60`, then
  `render()` with `renderAlpha = acc/STEP` so `ix(e)`/`iy(e)` interpolate between steps.
  Juice: `shake`, `hitStop`, goal `slow`-mo.
  ⚠️ **Anything that advances over time belongs in the step loop, not in a draw.** Trails
  (`advanceTrails`) and shake/flash (`decayJuice`) are called next to `step(world)` for this
  reason: when they ticked inside `render()` a 144Hz screen ran them 2.4× fast and the same
  match showed a 69-unit ball streak instead of 190. Draw functions only draw. Equally,
  anything anchored to a moving body must use `ix`/`iy`, not the raw position — mid-step
  they differ by up to a full step of travel. `tests/smooth.mjs` holds both lines.
- **Hit stop:** its own dial (`sel.hitStop`, `hitStopFrames()`), deliberately *not* under the
  Screen shake toggle. Fires on a goal, and on a **first touch** whose shot `predictsGoal()` has
  walked forward and seen go in — never on `releaseTrap` (a carried shot isn't a first touch).
  ⚠️ `predictsGoal` re-uses the real `moveBall`/`collide*` so it can't disagree with the physics,
  and `collideDiscs` writes to **both** bodies — so it runs on reused scratch copies and must stay
  provably inert. `tests/hitstop.mjs` diffs the whole world across 25 predictions.
- **State machine:** `world.state` ∈ `kickoff | play | goal | warmup | over`; `step()` advances it.
- **Full time:** `endMatch(w)` blows the whistle and sets `w.endRamp = 0`; `loop()` eases the step
  rate 1→0 over `FINAL_SLOW` seconds, then `finishMatch(w)` shows the result. ⚠️ The ramp is
  counted in `loop()` off **wall-clock**, never in `step()` — the sim rate is the thing being wound
  down, so it can't also be what measures the wind-down. `step()` integrates during `over` **only**
  while `endRamp != null`, otherwise the pitch freezes solid and there's nothing to see.
  Tests wanting the screen immediately call `endMatch` then `finishMatch`.
- **Result screen:** one panel per team (`renderMatchStats` → `.tpanel`), each reading players →
  score → that team's awards. `computeAwards` stays the one source of who won what; `awardRow`
  is the one place a ribbon is built. `renderAwards` now only holds the replay/clip footer.
- **Physics:** `integrate(w, ballFrozen, playersFrozen)` moves players then balls. `moveBall(w,ball,discs)`
  sub-steps a ball and collides vs players/posts/walls/arcs; `clampBallInside(w,ball)` is the hard
  containment backstop (the ball must NEVER leave the pitch except through the goal mouth — verify on
  every field after physics changes). Collisions: `collideDiscs`, `collideWall`, `collideArc`.
  Multi-ball extras live in `world.extraBalls`.
- **Input:** touch pads (`pads.p1/p2`, `onDown/onMove/onUp`), keyboard (`pollKeys`), gamepads
  (`gamepadPad`). `applyHumanInput(p, pad)` maps a pad to a player and applies cocktail rotation.
  ⚠️ It reads the pad every step, so setting `p.kick`/`p.inX` directly in a test gets overwritten —
  drive `pads.p1` or call `handleBallControl` instead.
- **Goal box:** the net pocket mirrored onto the pitch in front of each goal line — same
  mouth width, same depth — drawn OPEN (three sides; the goal line closes it) at
  `GOAL_BOX_A` alpha so the goal line stays the loudest mark down there.
  `tests/goalbox.mjs` checks the mirror is exact on all 30 fields by pixel sampling.
- **Render:** `render()` → `drawPitch`, `drawBallTrail`, `drawDiscs`, `drawBall` (+ extras), controls.
  Camera in `cam` / `computeCam()` (reserves top headroom for the HUD).
- **Themes:** `THEMES` → `applyTheme(key)` sets CSS custom properties AND the live `TH` canvas palette.
- **Dynamic visual themes:** a theme may also OWN its field and what a player *is*.
  `THEMES[k].dyn` names a `DYN_FIELDS` entry (`{reset?, step?, paint}`) that paints over the
  pitch surface; `THEMES[k].discs` names a `DISC_SKINS` entry that replaces `drawOneDisc`'s
  body. `warp` = black-and-white with a starfield tunnel; `pool` = a pool table with numbered
  solids vs stripes. ⚠️ Field state advances in `advanceDynField()` next to `step()`, **never
  in a paint** (same rule as the trails), and off its own seeded PRNG so it can't touch `w.rng`.
  A monochrome theme *must* supply a disc skin — player colour comes from `profile`, which no
  palette can reach. `tests/dyntheme.mjs` holds all of it by pixel sampling.
- **Cosmetics/unlocks:** `FLAGS` (draw fns + `_fh/_fv/_bg/_cd/_nordic/_oval` helpers), `ANIMALS`,
  `TEXTS`, `EYES`, `CAPS`, with `FLAG_REQ` / `EYE_REQ` / cap `.req`.
  `isUnlocked(cat,key)` = `grantedHas || reqMet(itemReq)`. **Flags, animals and text share one
  faceplate slot** (`profile.flag`) — `paintFace()` decides which table the key belongs to.
  `itemName(cat,key)` is the single place that knows what an item is called; use it, don't
  re-derive it. To add content: add the item + its unlock req and a `UNL_CATS` entry; the pickers
  and counters iterate the key lists. Players default to a **shirt number** (`shirtNo`).
- **Ball look:** `BALL_LOOKS` + `paintBall(c,x,y,r,rot,key)` — nine drawn patterns, no sprites.
  The pitch and the picker tiles call the same painter, so a tile can't show something the ball
  won't. Ball *physics* is `BALLS`, which is a different thing entirely.
- **Modes:** Season (`SEASON_ROUNDS`, `seasonEnd`), **Gauntlet roguelike** (`rogue`, `rogueNextRound`,
  `applyRoguePerks`, `rogueEnd`), drills (`DRILLS`, `stepDrill`), tutorial, party modifiers
  (`sel.party`). `endMatch(w)` routes `w.rogue`/`w.season` to their handlers.
- **Bots (AI-only layer):** `runBot(w,p)` in four layers — `botPhase` (attack/defend/transition)
  → `botAssignRoles` (chaser/support/defender/goalie, every `BOT.roleTicks` with a switch margin)
  → the per-bot decision → Layer-0 steering (`botArrive`, `botSeparate`, `botArcPoint`,
  `botWallAvoid`). Aim is `botPickAim` scoring shot / pass / bank / clear candidates through one
  function. **Every tuning value is in the `BOT` block** — nothing below it reads a magic number.
  ⚠️ Bots may write **only** `inX/inY/faceX/faceY/kick` and their own `ai*` scratch fields; the
  kick impulse runs along player→ball, so a bot aims by *where it stands*, not by facing.
  `tests/botai.mjs` enforces both by diffing the whole player object.
- **Determinism:** AI randomness goes through `w.rng` (`mulberry32`, seeded from `w.seed`, set
  outside the sim at `startMatch`). **Never call `Math.random` from inside `step()`.**
  `setMatchSeed(n)` pins a match for tests. See `docs/DETERMINISM-AUDIT.md`.
- **Map votes:** a thumbs up/down after each match, keyed on **(field, players per side)** —
  `mapVoteKey(w)` — because a map plays nothing alike 1v1 and 6v6. The size comes from the
  bodies actually FIELDED, not `mode.per`, since the lobby can put six a side on a 4v4.
  Stored in `localStorage` under `magnetball.mapvotes`; `mapVoteTable()` ranks the pairs and
  `buildMapVotes()` draws them on the career screen. `tests/mapvote.mjs` holds the split.
- **Progression:** `stats` (RP `points`, ranks, and Elo `mmr` via `updateMMR`). Saves in
  `localStorage` under `magnetball.*` keys.
- **Leaderboard:** `LB` config; reads via the public Google **gviz** JSON endpoint (`lbLoad`,
  `lbParseGviz`), writes scores/replays via an Apps Script (`lbSubmit`, `lbSubmitReplay`) if
  `LB.endpoint` is set. Falls back to a local sample when the sheet's unreachable.
- **Social/Watch:** local Instagram-style feed (`feed`, `buildFeed`, `drawClip`); Save-clip goals
  are pushed in for real.
- **Replays:** rolling `repBuf`; `repOnGoal` freezes it; `playReplay` re-renders (skippable);
  `saveClip` records via `MediaRecorder`.
- **Warm-up lobby:** `lobbyPlan(w)` is the **single source of truth** for who plays, on which
  side, and how many bots fill the gaps — `drawLobby` renders it and `lobbyStart` executes it,
  so the on-pitch preview can't disagree with what Start does. Standing on a half picks that
  team *including when everyone picks the same one* (six pads on one half = 6v6 vs bots);
  `spawnLobbyBot` builds bots to order when the mode's roster runs short. Bots the plan
  needs **walk on** to a random spot in the middle of their half and surplus ones walk off
  (`stepLobbyBots`, leaving faster than arriving), so the lobby shows the match you'd get
  rather than a row on the touchline — off `w.lobby.rng`, never `w.rng`, or how long someone
  spent choosing would change every bot decision in the match. The mode's seat
  count (`per*2`) is what actually caps controllers, not `LOBBY.maxPerSide`.
- **Auto-advance:** `AUTO` — the lobby kicks off by itself after 30s (`stepLobbyClock`, reset
  to full on movement, stick/KICK, or a pad connecting, and frozen during calibration) and the
  result screen starts the next match on the same config after 30s (`stepResultClock`, any input
  resets it). ⚠️ The result clock is counted on **wall-clock in `loop()`'s paused branch** —
  the result screen is a paused state, so `step()` isn't running. `tests/autoadvance.mjs`.
- **Menu shell:** the setup screen is an **accordion** — `openSection`/`collapseAllSections`,
  at most one card open. The **KICK OFF button is the Match card's `<h2>`**: pressing it starts a
  match, only the chevron beside it toggles the section, and `syncSticky()` measures that header
  for `--sticky-top`. `/settings` is the *same document* with the game switched off, kept in sync
  over `BroadcastChannel`.

## Testing (Playwright, headless)
Set `window.__MAGNETDEBUG = true` **before load** to expose `window.__magnet` — a live object with
getters for `world`, `stats`, `sel`, etc. and most functions (`startMatch`, `step`, `recordResult`,
`openRogue`, `computeAwards`, …). The hook MUST stay a **direct object literal with live getters**
(don't wrap it in `Object.assign`, which snapshots getter values).

Example (Node, Playwright installed at a known path):
```js
import pkg from 'playwright'; const { chromium } = pkg;
const b = await chromium.launch();
const p = await b.newPage();
await p.addInitScript(() => { window.__MAGNETDEBUG = true; });
await p.goto('file://' + process.cwd() + '/index.html');
const ok = await p.evaluate(() => {
  const M = window.__magnet; M.startMatch(); const w = M.world;
  w.state='play'; w.stateT=1; for (let i=0;i<120;i++) M.step(w);
  return isFinite(w.ball.x);
});
console.log(ok); await b.close();
```
`tests/run.mjs` runs all 52 suites; `tests/README.md` lists what each covers and the measurement
traps that have produced false results here before — read it before writing a new one.

Always: (1) render every new flag/eye/text/ball-look once to catch throwing draw fns, (2) re-verify
ball containment on all fields after physics changes, (3) check the console for errors, (4) assert
the thing you mean — several suites here have passed for the wrong reason.

## Gotchas
- `step(w)` takes the world (fixed internal STEP), not a dt.
- Duplicate element IDs break `$()` (getElementById) — watch when copying UI blocks.
- Service worker is **network-first for HTML**, so deploys show up on reload when online; bump
  `CACHE` in `sw.js` only if you need to force-evict other cached assets.
- Don't put model identifiers or internal session URLs in committed files.
- `p.kickUsed` is only cleared on the **one-touch** (`trapOff`) path. Gating anything on it in
  casual mode silently stops firing after the first kick.
- Duplicated knowledge rots. The category→name chain lived in three places and broke a test when a
  category was added; the contrast maths and the ball painter are each in one place now. Keep it
  that way.

## Deploy
Static hosting. GitHub Pages: files at repo root → Settings → Pages → `main` / root.
Leaderboard write path needs the Apps Script deployed (see `LEADERBOARD_SETUP.md`).
